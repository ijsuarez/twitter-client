# Project 4 - TwitLite

TwitLite is a basic twitter app to read and compose tweets the [Twitter API](https://apps.twitter.com/).

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can sign in using OAuth login flow
- [x] User can view last 20 tweets from their home timeline
- [x] The current signed in user will be persisted across restarts
- [x] In the home timeline, user can view tweet with the user profile picture, username, tweet text, and timestamp.
- [x] Retweeting and favoriting should increment the retweet and favorite count.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] User can load more tweets once they reach the bottom of the feed using infinite loading similar to the actual Twitter client.
- [x] User should be able to unretweet and unfavorite and should decrement the retweet and favorite count.
- [x] User can pull to refresh.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Added profile picture in the corner so user has visual feedback on who is logged in.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Xcode is saying that the GET and POST methods in TwitterClient.swift were deprecated. What is the new way of doing these things?
2. What's the best way to format numbers for "x time ago" types of formats?

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had some challenges properly parsing out the API. ~Right now there's a strange bug when trying to untweet my own retweets, but untweeting tweets that I have retweeted and that have been retweeted by others works fine.~ Fixed retweet error yayy.

- [ ] Profile Page
   - [ ] Implement the paging view for the user description.

   - [ ] Long press on tab bar to bring up Account view with animation
   - [ ] Tap account to switch to
   - [ ] Include a plus button to Add an Account
   - [ ] Swipe to delete an account

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Are notifications the best way to cause things to happen in other views when you're currently in a different one?
2. Is it bad practice to give segues the same identifiers?

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Twitter's API broke and says I retweeted something when the supposed retweet doesn't exist on my timeline, meaning I can't do anything about the mislabeled retweet.

There was an annoying syntax error with doing notifications since the function call had to had a : at the end of it and my app was crashing a bunch of times because I forgot about it.
